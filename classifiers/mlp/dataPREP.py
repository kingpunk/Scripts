Global Feature Descriptors
These are the feature descriptors that quantifies an image globally. These donâ€™t have the concept of interest points and thus, takes in the entire image for processing. Some of the commonly used global feature descriptors are

Color - Color Channel Statistics (Mean, Standard Deviation) and Color Histogram
Shape - Hu Moments, Zernike Moments
Texture - Haralick Texture, Local Binary Patterns (LBP)
Others - Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Threshold Adjancency Statistics (TAS)

"""
Local Feature Descriptors
These are the feature descriptors that quantifies local regions of an image. Interest points are determined in the entire image and image patches/regions surrounding those interest points are considered for analysis. Some of the commonly used local feature descriptors are

SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform)
SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features)
ORB (Oriented Fast and Rotated BRIEF)
BRIEF (Binary Robust Independed Elementary Features)
